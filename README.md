Predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using ML.

This project builds a classification model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster. It walks through the complete ML pipeline: data cleaning, feature engineering, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Tech Stack:
Python (Pandas, NumPy),
Scikit-learn,
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for exploration),
Custom Transformers (AgeImputer, FeatureEncoder, FeatureDropper)

Achieved 78% accuracy in Kaggle Competition submission.
